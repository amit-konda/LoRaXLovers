1	Just a headache from day 1.	"I purchased this computer about 2 months back.  I could not use it for my music lessons online (my teacher cannot hear me playing the instrument when on skype), tried all the recommendations online and it did not really work.  I called Dell Technologies for support (within a week of purchase) and the only thing the person could do for me for to suggest I get a paid support service from them (mind you I am still under warranty).<br />Next, when Microsoft did updates, my sound went out completely (I could not hear any music or videos).  I did all the troubleshooting and nothing helped.  Finally when I called they did help me this time, the lady reinstalled the sound software and it worked.<br />Now every few days, it seems to lock up the touchpad or lose sound, each time I reboot the computer, I don't know what issue I will face.  I have never had any issue with computers before this.<br />I will never buy a Dell Technologies again ever.  My last 2 pcs were HPs and they were really good and the service was excellent.  I bought this because the reviews were good, but I feel this is the worst, either I got a lemon or the reviews were biased."

4	Excellent general purpose laptop with a great screen (Worktop 15 5501)	"This is a review of the Dell Technologies Worktop 15 5501 15.6 inch FHD Laptop (Silver) Intel Core i7-1065G7 10th Gen, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, Nvidia Geforce MX330 2GB GDDR5, Windows 10 Home (i7501-7623SLV-PUS).<br /><br />Let's start with the basics:<br /><br />If you look at the picture with the System Info, you will see that I was delivered a laptop with an Intel i7-1065G7 CPU. The sales page states that this model should be equipped with an Intel 10750H, a new chip with different characteristics. The bottom line is that the old chip does use less power due to it's using 4 Cores, 8 Threads @1.30 GHz, at 15 W. The newer chip uses more power and thus drains the battery more quickly, but it is much faster using 6 Cores, 12 Threads @2.60 GHz, at 45 W.<br /><br />Notice also on the picture that shows the Display Info for this machine, this unit came equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce MX330, while the sales page says Nvidia Geforce GTX 1650 4GB GDDR6. In this case, the MX330 is a newer, better chip than the GTX so, I was downgraded on the CPU and upgraded on the GPU (Graphics chip)<br /><br />I think it evens out in that the faster display and more display memory probably offsets some of the lower computing power. I don't know for sure, I just know it's a different setup than I thought I was getting.<br /><br />I posted the results of the third-party testing that I did in the photos. As you can see the CPU (remember, this is not what was advertised, it is a slower version) came with an average rating of 55th percentile, nothing to write home about but then again, good for general use with no issues whatever. Notice that the GPU rates in the 90th percentile. This is the chip that was newer and better than advertised. Overall, compared to a ""budget laptop"" this 3rd party test showed this running about 143% better than a typical budget computer. Specifically, the CPU was 133% higher and the GPU was 247% higher. Again, this correlates to the slower CPU installed and the faster Graphics chip installed. Now, I wouldn't call this a ""budget"" computer and maybe the comparison was unfair. The other option for comparison was ""gaming computer"" and that would have made this look bad but would have been a very poor comparison. In general, I would expect that with this configuration, the computing speed and abilities of this unit is very much on par with others in its price range. After all, while this is not necessarily a ""budget"" computer, it's not a gaming computer or a $2500 laptop either.<br /><br />So, with the changes in power consumption how is the battery life of this laptop? I ran several tests, mostly just streaming video to see how long the battery would last. In each case, the battery was fully charged for several hours, left for at least 30 minutes to cool down, and then I would stream a few movies or live TV. On several tests, the battery lasted almost exactly 5 hours. In a few tests, the battery lasted six by using the battery saver function. I will say that I did not notice any difference in the quality of the video stream when I went to power-saving mode. With that in mind, I suggest that you stream using the saver mode, you'll get an extra hour and not feel the change.<br /><br />The battery took 2.5 hours to recharge from fully empty to 100%; this time was pretty consistent from charge to charge. In 1 hour it would charge to 50%.<br /><br />When using this in normal ""office mode"", i.e., opening and closing spreadsheets and documents, the occasional trip to the internet to look at cat photos, and letting it go idle as I ate my lunch, chit-chatted with fellow employees or rummaged through the supply closet, I got a full days' work in with some battery to spare.<br /><br />The screen is great; bright and sharp and is a pleasure to look at. The streaming videos looked as good as one could expect on a laptop and I enjoyed the viewing experience. With its almost edge to edge design, it is large enough to view movies and not feel as if you're losing out on a big screen. It is also light enough and slim enough to keep on your lap and view without it feeling clunky or weighing down on you. I'll also add that it did not run hot, a problem I've had with other laptops when placed on my lap. It runs quietly, you can watch videos without annoying fan noises.<br /><br />So far, mostly all good. What do I hate about this laptop? It's probably me but I find the distance from the laptops leading (front) edge to the keyboard just a bit too much of a stretch for me. If you will notice in the picture attached, I need to take my watch off of my left hand when I type; as you can see it is constantly getting caught on the edge of the laptop. Further, I just found the keyboard uncomfortable. Perhaps it's just different from my last keyboard but I find myself hitting the backslash key instead of the enter key and I can't seem to get comfortable with it. I switch keyboards often with no problem but perhaps this being so far back from the edge is throwing me off quite a bit.<br /><br />Overall, I like the form factor, except for the keyboard placement. The battery life is not great, but it's acceptable especially since when using it for work I will usually have it plugged in. Seeing as I don't often watch videos for more than 6 hours at a time the battery life is not an issue on that end either and actually, that long will get me cross country (on a plane of course) with no issues.<br /><br />Overall, this is just fine. More stars for its looks than its power, some points deducted for average battery life, and some deducted because Dell Technologies didn't have the decency to request my hand size or to ask me which wrist I wear my watch on before they finalized the design of the machine. Add some points back for a great display."

2	A Painful Experience	"Just to be clear,  as they have merged the reviews of several Dell Technologies laptop models;  I am reviewing a Dell Technologies Worktop 15 7501 laptop which was first released in July 2020.  It does not have an optical drive and is extremely light and thin for a laptop of this size.<br /><br />I decided to review this from the standpoint of someone getting their first computer.  I am somewhat suited for such a task,  having not owned a PC since Windows 98.  That said I was shocked by what a miserable experience it was trying to activate and operate this Dell Technologies Worktop 15 out of the box.  Part of this is simply what happens when a Mac user encounters a PC.  And part is more directed at Windows 10 than against the features of this specific PC model.<br /><br />Judging from this,  over the past 20+ years there has been little that I would regard as improvements made to entry level Dell Technologies laptops,  while complexity has increased geometrically it seems to have been almost entirely in the service of showcasing silly gimmicks.  It is certainly a more powerful machine than my 1998 PC,  so the internet connection permits streaming and gaming applications;  and apparently it can handle ZOOM but I have had it for over six weeks and am still getting nowhere trying to utilize this feature.<br /><br />My 1998 PC out of the box had an optical drive and the installed software to run Excel and Word. And with a simple driver could link to and operate a printer and a scanner.  Navigation could be figured out in a couple of hours.<br /><br />But out of the box with this 2020 version I have been limited to accessing the internet and to sending and receiving email.  That has been the sum total of its functionality.  Although based on Amazon's product detail page there are all sorts of bells and whistles designed into this machine.  To be fair,  with my basic computer needs I suspect that even if I could figure out how to activate them they would be of little value.  I really wish the designers of these basic machines would spend less time trying to dazzle buyers with things that complicate their lives and come out with something that could simply be plugged and immediately applied to a useful purpose.<br /><br />Within hours of opening the box I was wishing that I had not attempted to use it as there were so many invasive questions asked during the registration and set-up that I expect to be plagued with thousands of spam emails over the next decade.  I think that I switched off most of the “receive offers” options and hopefully avoided disclosing my telephone number but I regret ever opening up this can of worms.  I had my first unwanted email within minutes of disclosing my address.<br /><br />What you get in the box is the laptop itself and a power cord (no mouse although that is a quick enough fix).  There are also two small brochures with microscopic print regarding warranty information and several tiny diagrams with minimal explanation.  When you turn it on they begin extracting personal information and internet connection details.  The operation of the laptop and the operating system are not intuitive so if you are not an experienced PC user make sure you have someone handy who can help you navigate the operation of this device.  The screen is pretty much blank and there are few hints about where to find files or downloads.  Portable hard drives and optical drives are only acknowledged,  reading them requires outside apps or guidance.<br /><br />It took me 40 minutes just to figure out how to use their menu to enter my date of birth,  it would not allow me to just type it in the field.  It  took about the same amount of time for Cortina (the chatty set-up assistant) and I to give up on activating the  fingerprint reader;  she simply stopped prompting me and I thought it was finally activated - but the next time I tried to log-on it did not work.  I was  able to access the internet and I eventually I stumbled across the Microsoft Office software.  But the software requires yet another registration and is only good for seven days before you have to purchase a subscription; seriously can't Dell Technologies just provide generic pre-installed software for something this basic?<br /><br />To be fair there are online courses and books that will allow you to track up the learning curve and there is always on-line tech support if you want to devote even more hours to the task.<br /><br />First impression is that this is a flimsy feeling laptop,  with moderate effort you could fold the screen in half.  Overall a huge disappointment for me but a seasoned Windows 10 user will not experience the same setup irritations."

5	This laptop feels like art!	"This thing is absolutely a beautiful laptop.  I love the hinge that lifts the laptop ever so slightly to allow better cooling.  It looks great and is a truly great idea.  I've shown the laptop to a few people and the most common reaction is something like ""Wow, that looks great"" then they take a picture of the hinge mechanism!<br /><br />I love the thinness of the bezel.  No longer a thick wide chunk of plastic, it's a thin silver colored little edge that really gives this laptop the look of a truly superior product.<br /><br />The performance is fantastic, but I am going from an older machine so it will be.  I do not have a reasonable machine here to compare it against, but it handles everything I need with absolutely no issues or lag.  I'm not compiling source code or doing video manipulation or anything as such that would require a lot of power, but again this thing is quick.<br /><br />One thing I appreciate is that it has a ""normal"" HDMI port like is on all my AV equipment.  My other laptops have the PC version which is flat on the one side so a regular HDMI cable won't plug into it...  That's something that's always frustrated me.  I haven't used the HDMI yet, but it's on my todo list with the laptop connected to the projector.  We'll see.<br /><br />Absolutely pleased beyond expectation going from my prior laptop to this one.  In the photos you can see it compared to my prior laptop."

5	It’s perfection.	I had a Dell Technologies years ago when I was in college for my bachelors degree and I loved it. I have not used it since and I recently (10 years later) decided to go back for my masters. I took out my old Dell Technologies and unfortunately it had windows vista and did not have the requirements needed to update. I made the dumb decision to go the cheaper route and got an HP. 5 months later and I wised up and got this bad boy. Dell Technologies does not disappoint. The keyboard does light up. It is all very user friendly. And I didn’t even realize the screen is touch screen until 2 days later. So that was an added bonus. There is plenty of memory and storage. The display is amazing. The keyboard is just fabulous. The batter life is great. I only have to charge every 3 days or so but I don’t do a whole lot other than school work on it. I don’t know what I was thinking trying anything other than Dell Technologies. I recommend this laptop. It is worth every penny.

1	😡😡😡😡 Angry	"I bought this laptop for school because I got specific hardware/software instructions from the school. I thought I found all the required specifications in this laptop including Microsoft Office 365; which was advertised on this model. All my laptops to this date came with a Microsoft office suite and seeing this one was so expensive, I quickly accept that it indeed had all the specifications listed. However, after a few days I tried using Office and it kept telling me to register paying a monthly fee. I finally called Dell Technologies and was told that the Microsoft 365 that was on the specifications was only a trial and I have to buy this monthly/yearly subscription If I want to use it. The main reason for which I bought the computer I can’t use it for that purpose and I paid so much money for it. Now, it’s a little over a month and I can’t return the computer. THIS IS A RIP OFF. Dell Technologies need to pay for false advertising. What’s the sense in paying over a thousand $ for a computer if you can’t use it??? My last laptop that I bought a few years ago didn’t have this problem. Dell Technologies thinks I have money to waste??? I am very frustrated now because school starts in a week and I don’t have a computer to use having just bought this one 5 1/2 weeks ago for so much money. 😡😡😡😡"	B0897X5DTP	AF3PUZTACYFTHKEORP2DADKDZ36Q	1.60E+12	5	Computers	"Dell Technologies Worktop 15 7000-15 Inch FHD Touchscreen, Intel Core i7, 8GB Memory, 512GB Solid State Drive, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 4GB GDDR6, Windows 10 Home (Latest Model) - Silver"	4.4	46	"[Wifi-6 802.11 AX wireless, Single Sign-on fingerprint reader, Lid-open sensors, Adaptive Thermals, Lift Hinge for improved typing angle, Backlit Keyboard]"	899.99	Dell Technologies	"[Electronics, Computers & Accessories, Computers & Tablets, Laptops, Traditional Laptops]"				7	4.14	28190	Windows 10 Home	Silver	Dell Technologies
4	Gamer and movie lover.	"I didn't buy my laptop on Amazon, I bought it from Dell Technologies around April 2012.  Now over 2 years later I still love my laptop.  It still runs quietly and quickly.  All my buttons still work and my battery still runs well.  I still get about 3-4 hours of solid surfing and streaming time before I start charging it.  It charges fairly quickly even while you're on it.  One of the things I really love about this laptop is the sound.  I have friends that have acer and apples and when we gather around, we use my laptop instead because we can actually hear what's playing.<br /><br />I use this computer heavily for gaming, streaming, listening to music, drawing, internet surfing.  I use my laptop on avg 4-6 hours a day. I have dropped it a couple times off my bed or couch from a height of about 2-3' and it still runs great. There's a touch sensitive shortcut bar on the top right where the power button is that's backlit for wi-fi connection, settings, launch manager, and sound. Even though my wrists cover it sometimes, it still is good.<br /><br />Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU @2.40GHz<br />RAM: 8GB<br />System Type: 64-bit Operating System<br />I use Windows 7.<br /><br />I use my laptop heavily for gaming, streaming, listening to music, surfing, drawing, and I upload a lot of photos. I also have a dual monitor setup.<br /><br />I've only used the cd/dvd player/burner for installing software and I've used the built in webcam a couple times.  Both work fine still.<br /><br />Some cons:<br /><br />As in some reviews, my power cord does slip out easily when I have it on my lap and shift it.  Although this doesn't really bother me too much as my friend's laptop cord sticks, and when she tripped over her power supply cord she took her laptop with her.<br /><br />I agree with some other reviewers that the design could be improved.  I think the speakers should've been placed where your wrists can't block them, however the sound is good this isn't a big deal to me.<br /><br />I do hit the touch pad at some instances, but I guess I automatically adjusted.  I do however, sometimes hit something in the bottom left area where my keys end up doing all short cut keys.  The only way I revert it back is by logging out, restarting, or randomly type all over till it goes back.<br /><br />This is my first laptop, before I was an avid desktop user.  Getting used to typing on it, especially at night in bed, was difficult.  I was jealous of my friends backlit keyboard for awhile.<br /><br />The weight of this laptop is a bit much.  I can lift regularly and easily about 25lbs throughout the day.  I have a thin canvas bag I carry my laptop around.  I have to turn it so the battery bump is away from my hip.  Also, because of the laptop's size and power it takes, I'm also carrying my power supply around.  I suggest if you get a bag for this, to get a backpack for more comfortable transportation.  I lived in a major city and traveling got tiresome after awhile.<br /><br />Just recently after 2.5years I've had some trouble with the usbs.  It has trouble recognizing my devices or if there is a device connected at all.  A friend of mine who is good at computers has fixed it, except had to disable the built-in camera  because I now have an incorrect driver.  He thinks this was caused by a virus though.<br /><br />I would recommend this for anybody who likes a big screen, watches a lot of movies, and is a gamer.  This is a great desktop substitute.  Be weary if you travel a lot and are not frequently near a power source."

5	Simply Amazing and A Joy to Drive!!!	"All I can say is I am not a geek. I just like to get it right the 1st time and do it all over again when the time comes.You get what you pay for. It indeed was pricey,however pricey lasts longer than going cheap!<br /><br />If you get this machine, please get it with the i7 with all the bells and whistles! That is the best option for your money. This machine has been a joy to drive just like my BMW X5 has been for years, if you now what I mean. The 3D (glassed included) is the best (I purchased another pair for the wife when traveling), the back lit screen nobody else has and just thinks it's amazing and the JBL speakers just sound awesome. The blue ray is pretty cool too.<br /><br />I use it a lot for work. I work with seniors so the big 17&#34; screen is what I needed and it has suited my needs just fine in that respect both professionally and personally. Although it is a bit weighty, I don't care. It's more powerful than my desktop! This Jan 2015 will be 3 years. If this laptop is still available. &#34;GET IT STILL&#34;!<br /><br />I have 2 extended batteries that lifts the back up to a nice typing tilted position and also allows for air flow. I change them out ever few months and use them both. The hump at the back of the battery also assist in grabbing it out of your bag. I have 8gb and can expand it to 16. Then, there is also all that technical stuff that comes along for the ride too, but remember I'm not a geek I just Love driving it! 11/01/2014"	B0052F35I2	AEQXA6DX6XYS2OOSNE7CO7JTSSBA	1.41E+12	1	Computers	"Dell Technologies ABC 17 Laptop, i7-2630QM, 8GB DDR3 Memory, 17.3in FHD WLED AG (1920x1080) Screen, NVIDIA GeForce GT 555M 3GB graphics with Optimus, 500GB HARD DRIVE 7200 RPM Hard Drive,"	3.5	22	"[Intel Core i7 Processor 2GHz, 6GB DDR3 RAM, 640GB 7200RPM Hard Drive, 17.3-Inch Screen, GeForce GT, Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium]"	None	Dell Technologies	"[Electronics, Computers & Accessories, Computers & Tablets, Laptops, Traditional Laptops]"				12	1.42	28243	Windows 7		Dell Technologies
4	"Great laptop overall, with some irritating problems that emerge after longer use."	"Alright I'm going to give this laptop an honest review because I have actually owned and tested this laptop for over two years now. I will have to say that is a remarkable laptop, but overheating is huge issue with this laptop. This laptop is without question a desktop replacement as a cooling pad is required if you plan on doing any type of gaming/processor heavy work. The laptop itself is a very well built and has survived being thrown around in my backpack (With a case of course.)  And is still chugging away happily despite having chipped off plastic on the back of my laptop. The ABC 17  has also survived two cases where I accidentally poured a little water onto the keyboard, and was solved quickly after I bathed my laptop in dry rice to absorb the liquid. That being said it's great laptop.<br /><br />However its parts are not so great. The laptop is programmed to refuse any non-Dell Technologies products. So if you want to replace something and your laptop is no longer under warranty. Despite there being a third-party product with the exact same specifications the ABC 17 will not allow for it. This is true for both the laptop battery, (which will no longer hold a charger after approximately six months) and the Charging cord.<br /><br />So ultimately, good laptop overall. But has overheating problems and when it comes time to repair the laptop it will be pricier than you will expect."

1	could've been great - things keeping getting worse	"My old Dell Technologies 8600 was on it's way out so I was looking for the next machine to replace it.  I keep my computer for a long time, so I wanted to get the best I could get.  I also didn't plan on carrying it around, so I wanted a large screen size.  This machine looked like it fit the bill.  First, the machine started out really well.  It is fast.  The hi res panel is pretty nice.  The video card is pretty good too.  My initial impressions were all good.<br /><br />Once I started using it I noticed a major problem with the touch pad.  The touch pad placement is wrong.  The touch pad is offset about a half inch to the right.  that means that your right palm will hit the touch pad when you type.  That will cause the cursor to jump around.  It is very frustrating and one has to wonder who the genius was who though that was a good idea.  The touch pad should be centered on the letter B not the letter N.<br /><br />That was the first negative.  Unfortunately it was not the last.  This is a high end machine and I had high expectations.  After 13 months the battery died.  My prior Dell Technologies's battery lasted much longer time.  It lasted more than 3 years before I had to replace it.  The other annoying problem is that right around the same time the battery died, the power plug no longer would stay connected to the back of the computer.  So besides the battery dieing now it is difficult to charge the battery.<br /><br />Overall this is a powerful computer that let me down because of the poor design of the touchpad and the power system.  They cut corners on the battery and the power plug system.  When you consider the cost, that is inexcusable.  In the past I would only buy Dell Technologies computers.  Now I am rethinking that.  My next computer will probably be a different brand.  I've heard good things about Sony's.<br /><br />6/2013 Update***<br /><br />I just dropped the rating from 3 stars to 1 star.  Why the change?  Because I have had two more issues with the computer.  Both are due to poor design.  The first new issue has to do with the power supply.  For some stupid reason Dell Technologies thought it would be a good idea to not charge the battery if the computer does not recognize the power supply that is plugged in.  You can still use the computer, but the battery will not be charged.  The was it identifies the powersupply is by the tiny wire that sticks out of the middle of the power supply plug.  If that gets broken off or if the internal wire connection goes bad, you get no charging.  Google Dell Technologies power supply problem and you can read all about this STUPID design.  Luckily the fix is pretty easy, just get a new power supply.  I found a used one on ebay at a reasonable cost.  So I can once again charge my battery.<br /><br />The next problem is the headphone jack went bad.  You would think, hey this machine has two jacks so I can just use the second.  Unfortunately this very common failure mode is not that the jack stops working when you plug in a headphone.  Instead the failure is that the computer thinks you always have headphones plugged in and the built in speakers no longer produce sound.  Again, this is a common failure due to bad design.  This is really inexcusable for a high end machine.  I'm done with buying Dell Technologies computers.<br /><br />9/2014 update<br />Just as sudden as the audio jack went bad, it came back.  The sound is back.  To play it safe I only use the second jack when I plug in headphones.  My rating still stays the same as this is a problem that should never have happened."

4	I like	"I ordered this directly form Dell Technologies when it first came out. I do like this laptop for regular use and even gaming. I love the size of the screen, though, i have had problems where there would be a &#34;ghost touch&#34; (I have the touch screen version). There would be random &#34;touches&#34; even after Dell Technologies replaced the screen under extended warranty but it still continues so i disabled this function. Other than this, it is a good running laptop, though, the outside material seems cheap and where my palm sits wihle using the &#34;asd&#34; or &#34;qwer&#34; keys was getting a little faded but i used a LCD screen protector and i have no problem with it now. I only have the i5 version and it is still good. Mine also did not come with blue-ray.

1	Another steaming heap by Dell Technologies...	"I bought this to treat myself to something nice about 3 years ago. I have a business grade Dell Technologies as well which works nicely, but I would advise all to stay far, FAR away from consumer level Dell Technologies products - whether low or high end. They just don't work, period.<br /><br />It takes about 3 minutes to boot in Windows 7 professional, even after clean install. Then it takes another 5 minutes for all the programs to get fully loaded up; very laggy during this time. It's like an arthritic grandpa trying to get out of bed. Sometimes I just have to restart the whole thing b/c it starts lagging so heavily I can't do crap without the stupid clock icon coming and spinning or programs timing out.<br /><br />I've 16 gb ram BTW, so I don't know what the heck is wrong with Dell Technologies's MOBO/CPU architecture that causes all these issues.<br /><br />Battery, like someone else said, runs down in less than a year. It's also poorly seated, so anytime you jiggle the laptop a little bit wrong, the whole thing just turns off.<br /><br />Congrats Dell Technologies, you've succeeded in introducing another steaming heap to the market."

5	Amazing Laptop!	"I ordered this with trepidation because I read more than a few reports of problems right out of the box. Not for me.. fortunately. I am upgrading from a Dell Technologies ABC 1730 with 2 nvidea SLI graphics cards. In MHO.. the SLI thing was not successful.. many games could not detect it.. and the machine ran very hot, all the time. This machine is a total wowser.. there are low end graphics on the motherboard that are fine for word processing, etc.  but the 3G Nvidia card is fabulous! I am playing SkyRim with everything set to very high. The framerate is great.. the screen and graphics are so spectacular that I often stop and spend a long time just admiring the view in the game! The raised lip on the battery keeps everything cool..the system  does blow some heat when really working but the fan is quiet. The speakers are nice, the Blue Ray drive runs quiet ( my old one sounded like it was trying to give birth!) The windows rating for this is only 5.9.. I think 7200 rpm drives are slow.. but only in comparison to everything else.. the other scores were between 6.9 and 7.6. The battery life is also awesome. I got 5 hours just playing games and watching CD's. Impressive. I wish I had got the model with the backlit keyboard and the 3d glasses ( I am sending away for the 3d stuff, can't do anything about the keyboard tho)..Other than that I could not be happier with this purchase.  PS..If you purchase one of these,  go on the Dell Technologies support page and run the graphics diagnostics on  this rig.. it will blow you away."

1	Have had to reset computer system twice in less than a week without being able to recover my files.	I have had this laptop for less than a week and have had it go into system recovery mode where I had to reset the entire computer for it to work. I could not use any of the options to restore the computer to save any of my files when it occurred both times. I also frequently have to restart the computer randomly during use because certain games and programs will not open unless I restart the system.

La recibí sellada de fabrica.<br />Para trabajo y estudio es mas que excelente y sobrado, si te importa el peso, esta no es para ti, yo con todo gusto cargo esta laptop valorando sus capacidades. Si quieres una laptop que te dure la batería todo el día, búscate una laptop no gamer.<br />Para juegos es una maquina que no esperaba que fuera tan potente, y no esperaba que viniera con una RTX 3060 de 130w, ... feliz! La calidad de pantalla y el brillo es excelente aunque sea de 250 nits, son suficientes para que te duelan los ojos de la intensidad del brillo. Uso el brillo en 50% y es mas intenso que una laptop de bajo precio con brillo al maximo.<br />Es el equipo mas económico con Hybrid/Optimus (switch MUX), y es una gran ventaja para sacar todo el potencial de la RTX 3060 (15-20 fps adicionales con Optimus en Off), esta característica era importante para mi porque puedo tener toda la potencia de la gpu en la pantalla del mismo equipo y no depender de una pantalla externa para saber su verdadera capacidad.<br />La batería en optimus para ofimática y vídeos dura aproximadamente 3 horas y 45 minutos.<br />La refrigeración me parece muy funcional y muy silenciosa, con 4 salidas (2 laterales y 2 traseras) y 2 entradas amplias (por la parte de abajo y la parte superior, entre el teclado y la pantalla), recomiendo utilizar una muy buena base de refrigeración adicional para darle vida en el tiempo y cuidar tu inversión.<br />La tecla G activa la máxima velocidad de los ventiladores (para nada molestos) así como el brillo pero aun no he verificado si las frecuencias de la cpu o gpu suben, pero sin activar la tecla G es lo suficientemente potente para correr tus juegos en máxima calidad sin contratiempos.<br />Sobre el acabado, es de plástico, pero en mi opinión personal es plástico de muy buena calidad, excelente ensamble, muy solida por todos lados, fuerte, resistente y muy buen acabado. No es una laptop con diseño excesivo gamer, pero es diferente a una laptop común, discreta pero con un toque especial, sobrio y elegante.<br />Viene con Windows 11 para inicializar, que me parece mucho mejor que con windows 10 actualizable y tener problemas de drivers luego.<br /><br />En resumen, encontré todas las características que  buscaba por el dinero que pensaba invertir, hasta el momento cero fallas, gran potencia para juegos actuales. Si falla, actualizare este comentario."

5	Great for streaming and gaming	"I love this laptop! Great for gaming and works very well for streaming along with OBS. The touch screen is fun and convenient.<br /><br />The only real issue I’ve had is the resolution is so big and often unsupported that some programs will open looking VERY crisp but way too small. Sometimes you can fix this by manually setting the resolution; other times it will be a choice between a slightly blurry program or one too small to read easily. For drawing/editing programs, this could be a concern.<br /><br />Regardless, I still use it daily and it works well for what I want it to do (streaming).<br /><br />I’ve also accidentally knocked it over a few times (oops!) and it has held up perfectly fine with a plastic case and keyboard cover I purchased from Amazon."

1	Horrible product / Motherboard defective	"Mother board defective and  unrepairable. Purchased this item just over a year ago. It has never worked properly and finally after several small fixes it stopped working completely 13 months, one month after the warranty expired. I contacted the company to discuss replacement options and received a  flat refusal to assist or discuss since the product was one month outside of warranty. From a warranty stand point I understood their position but from a  customer service and ethical position i feel their unwillingness to replace the item is unacceptable. If I had brought this issue to them several months or years after the warranty expiration date I would understand their objection but find it classless that a company cares more about the black letter of the warranty versus customer satisfaction and quality of the product they are putting out there.

1	Inept service at best	"The joy of Dell Technologies Service…NOT!<br /><br />I purchased an Advance M15 R3 with 3 year  accident protection April  1, 2021 at Microcenter in Mayfield Hts, OH, (no reflection on them, been shopping there since 1996).<br /><br />12-8-2021: I noticed my screen was damaged and called for service after performing the Dell Technologies diagnostics, etc. After the Dell Technologies rep confirmed my screen was damaged  with pictures submitted, a screen was ordered and a tech was dispatched. My computer WAS WORKING, I could use an hdmi cable, screenshare, or limp along with an ugly display.<br /><br />12-10-2021 Tech arrived, seemed nice and knowledgeable. During the screen replacement the tech damaged my motherboard leaving my computer down. I was not happy but accidents happen. I was with him when it happened and when he notified his company. The nightmare begins. I told the tech I was leaving over the weekend and traveling 600 miles away and needed the laptop fixed. Documents are stored on the pc and needed, while traveling my phone and tablet will not do the job. I gave him the address of where I will be and the dispatch info was saved.<br /><br />12-13-2021 Checked online for status and got the “We’re sorry, we don’t have one or more parts needed for your service.” notice.<br /><br />12-14-2021 Called Worldwide TechServices (contracted Dell Technologies repair agent) They have no access to Dell Technologies parts information.<br /><br />12-14-2021 Checked status online again. Same notice, called support. Spoke with Neil, was informed parts were in the area and I would be notified.<br /><br />12-16-2021 After checking multiple times online with no ETA for parts I called again. The motherboard is back ordered. NO INFO given.<br /><br />12-17-2021 41 minute call, asked for supervisor. Had to explain again my issues and why hasn't my pc been fixed. Insisted I speak with a supervisor to get the situation resolved. As most phone reps, he apologized often, was sympathetic, and could not resolve my problem as he did not have access to parts and could not authorize a replacement unit. I was promised a call back by the end of business that day, I missed the call but received the following email.<br /><br />Rxxxxx,<br /><br />I just left you a voicemail with this information as well but just wanted to double down on the communication, I don't have an ETA for the motherboard that we are going to replace for you yet, the matter has been escalated to my peers in charge of the shipping of this parts and units and as soon as we have an update we will communicate with you again.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Axxxxx Bxxxxxxxx<br />Supervisor, Client Tech Support<br /><br />12-19-2021 No change online, still no information on parts. At least Dell Technologies is consistent.<br /><br />Here I am the 9th day without a pc, out of town, needing my pc so I can finish up a large project during the holiday season.<br /><br />Do I believe Dell Technologies’s contracted tech services will be available during xmas week?<br /><br />Will Dell Technologies get me an exchange or loaner?<br /><br />Will Dell Technologies do the right thing and honor a contract?<br /><br />If you believe Dell Technologies will do any of those things...I hope Santa, The Easter Bunny, and any other made up marketing ploy grants all your wishes!<br /><br />Dell Technologies broke my computer, lied to me about the status of my repair, and NO ONE from Dell Technologies cares to honor a contract we both entered into. I was fine with paying for the service I was expecting. Dell Technologies on the other hand enjoys taking my money for both a computer and extended warranty and not delivering either!<br /><br />Avoid these grifters!"

I've used it a year and have played some older games on it and Red Dead 2 which is newest game. The laptop is great for the money but definitely has some disappointments. Mostly the battery life is not good even just web use gets you 2 hours or so tops. Gaming I found it played most games just fine, but laptop runs hot. Play long enough and you will see frames drop as performance throttles back. 120Hz screen is decent and mine has red backlit keyboard which I find not ideal.

4	Gaming for a decent price	I’ve read allot of the reviews and wonder if they have the same laptop. I dropped in Cold War and was quite impressed. You definitely need to update Nvidia graphics to take on better performance. I did notice that at 125ghz refresh you definitely need a gaming monitor with 125-225ghz or can get screen tearing. The backlit keyboard display isn’t bad by any means. I am a DJ as well work from home and at night the keyboard functions awesome especially working in low light conditions. The response time for the processor is as fast as your reflexes when gaming. I have never had a death where the kill came out of nowhere (lagging refresh) as well missed opportunity.<br /> All in all is high performance and at a decent budget with super fast start up.

3	"For the price it's a good deal, but you could do much better..."	An RTX 3060 laptop for under $1400 (with $140 discount at the time of purchase) seemed like a good deal but to get to that price point a lot was sacrificed it seems.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Price was affordable<br />- Build quality is very sturdy.  Very little flex in the chassis or screen.<br />- In-stock.  Nearly everything else I wanted was out of stock or price gouged by scalpers<br />- No dead pixels as far as I can tell.<br />- Nice speakers but fans can still be heard over them.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- TDP of 3060 is only 90 watts.  Confirmed with GPU-Z.<br />- Gets VERY Hot.  GPU easily hit 90 degrees Celsius then crashed while gaming from overheating.<br />- Keyboard is not great.  Missed key presses constantly and using red letters on black keys is a terrible idea.<br />- Mux switch is in the BIOS and can not be changed in Windows<br />- Bloatware.  512gb SSD but only 407gb free.<br />- Some backlight bleed.  Very noticeable on dark scenes.<br />- Ships with dead battery.  I thought I had a DOA unit cause it would not boot up.<br />- Color is not black.  It's a very dark dirty grey unlike the pictures.<br /><br />Overall its a nice laptop but I was mislead by reviews online and and the Q&A section that this was the high wattage 3060.  Due to the thermal issue I'm guessing that's why they opted for the lower watt version.  The cooling could be better IMHO as evidenced by the crashes I experience from overheating.  If you can get it on a sale and not MSRP its a better deal than most 3050 ti laptops.  It's good enough for basic gaming but don't expect to run modern games on it at high framerates/quality.  Despite having a Core i7 CPU I'm constantly experiencing system stuttering which could be a windows issue or caused by all the bloatware.  Dell Technologies did not include any backup disks or a restore option so I can not uninstall anything without losing it forever.  I will update my review after the return period is over to see if it holds up.

5	Great so far!	"I am not a professional gamer but I needed a laptop for work since I travel and wanted to have the ability to still play some games here and there. So far it has done everything I need it to. Great performance while working and so far great performance while playing dead by daylight, sims 4, and genshin impact. Battery isn’t the greatest but can’t expect to game while on battery alone. Screen quality is pretty great for me as well as sound. I do like it has usb type c for charging my phone since everyone is starting to go away with traditional usb. PLEASE NOTE: the keyboard backlight is only available in the redish orange color not multi color RGB!!! This is not a setback for me but it may be for others. Windows 11 installed with no issues either and I am planning on upgrading the ram and adding more storage in the future. Like any new electronic just plug it into its charger and let the battery charge for a good 30 min before starting to get into the updating! Another note to consider is this laptop automatically turns on when you open the lid from a full shut down. Not a let down but it may be for others."

Anyone buying gaming computers knows this isn't the best one out there but for the price, it's good. I gave it 4 stars because it shouldn't be sold with only 8g of RAM.

5	Great Computer - Replaced my horribly flawed  Dell Technologies ABC M1330	"This Dell Technologies was a full replacement from the Dell Technologies ABC M1330 - which I bought fully loaded and burned out after eight months of medium use, and again a year later, because they built the graphics card on the motherboard. - Regardless this is not a review for the ABC M1330 - Just be aware it was the worst computer made.<br /><br />I have been very happy with this replacement.<br /><br />1) Stays cool after heavy use<br />2) speakers are amazing<br />3) keyboard lights are amazing<br />4) scroll pad on the laptop is great<br />5) speed is good<br />7) Screen is amazing playing blue ray<br />8) heavy but it acts as a desktop of sorts<br /><br />I got mine fully loaded with the second to highest CPU chip - overall Ill avoid Dell Technologies in the future but if my computer breaks, id  consider buying the same one again since I know in this circumstance Dell Technologies did a good job on this model - wish they could ensure their quality across the board."

2	"Incredibly awesome audio, but suffers from Nvidia issues yet again."	"My specs: Dell Technologies ABC l502x (Purchased May 2011)<br />Processor: i5 2410M<br />RAM: 6GB<br />HDD: 640 gb 7200 hard drive<br />Resolution: 1366 x 768<br />Video card: GeForce 540M 2GB<br /><br />First off: the audio on this model is truly incredible for the price range. The JBL speakers with subwoofer make it unnecessary to have to plug your laptop in to external speakers for almost any situation (except of course... parties and what have you). In fact, you'd truly be hard pressed to find better audio quality in a laptop even now. The new Lenovo y410 and y510 models do come with JBL speakers, however they are not of the same quality.<br /><br />The keyboard is comfortable for my usage, since I have fairly large hands. I have heard that some people complain about the spacing between keys, but honestly... unless you have tiny fingers I don't really understand how it's an issue.<br /><br />The screen quality is pretty good for the price and resolution.<br /><br />Now for the bad.. well, horrible.<br /><br />The battery quality is horribly sub par; the 9cell battery I purchased with the unit barely kept about one hour charge after a year and at current lasts about 35-40 minutes with wireless enabled. Considering that the laptop is plugged in almost 85% of the time, this is fairly terrible.<br /><br />And most importantly (or annoyingly), the video card. The Nvidia GeForce 540M comes with either 1GB or 2GB of dedicated video memory. I opted for the 2GB over the 1GB merely because it was only about a $20 upgrade at the time of purchase. The card has pretty solid reviews on notebookcheck in terms of performance and can play modern games at decent quality. However (and this is a HUGE however), the thing crashes. It crashes a whole ton. Like a ridiculously ludicrous amount. And by crash, I do mean that the entire computer freezes along with a looping stuttering audio sound (which is incredibly loud and annoying) and must be powered down via the button.<br /><br />There are several theories as to why the video card crashes (be it overheating, which obviously can occur in laptops, or more commonly, with this video card, that there is an issue with the clock speed). While it is possible to lower the amount of crashes by a great deal by switching to the integrated graphics card, I eventually found that this card would freeze during certain games, such as Starcraft 2. You can also go the ""underclock the core speed of your 540M main card"" which will also lower the frequency of crashes, but they still do inevitably occur under medium to heavy load. This could be an issue with the motherboard, 540M speed, etc. and that would be fine if Dell Technologies acknowledged the issue and voluntarily replaced or provided solutions to fix the crashing errors. But they haven't. In fact, they have gone a highly petty route by forcing users to extend warranties and continually replace the motherboard and video card. Oh, I said petty because on their forums, they also mute people and delete comments on their forums who even whisper anything overly negative about the computer or Dell Technologies's possible knowledge that they shipped out faulty components with the laptops and did not voluntarily pull the laptops back to replace said faulty components (if you read Dell Technologies community forum posts in regards to how frequently and readily Dell Technologies replaced motherboards for this laptop, it becomes fairly obvious they know of the issue).<br /><br />Yes, it would cost them money to replace everyone's faulty components. But this is a premium laptop and by my standards, shipping out a laptop with faulty components is essentially shipping out an incomplete product, which Dell Technologies should be held liable for.<br /><br />I am honestly stuck at a crossroads for rating this laptop. On the one hand, everything but the video card and battery runs perfectly and as it should, and the audio quality is superb. But Dell Technologies's horrible business practices in regards to informing their customers of faulty hardware (this also happened with the ABC M1530 line, see Nvidia 8 series class action lawsuit) leads me to have to ultimately give this laptop a 2/5."

5	Great for business & graphics	"I bought mine direct from Dell Technologies (preferred customer) to replace my tired<br />Studio 1550.<br />i7, 2.2ghz, 1tb drive, 8 gig ram, GT525 & intel HD graphics, JBL sound,<br />bluetooth etc.<br /><br />1st thing I do is set it up, and then pull the HDD out, pop in a clean one,<br />and set it up my way, and leave the ""factory"" drive on the shelf with the<br />expiration date of the warranty.  If I have a warranty claim, pop in THEIR<br />drive with no personal data on it and send it back.<br />I didn't get the back-lit keyboard.<br />This thing screams on photoshop, which I use daily.  Keyboard is responsive,<br />and easier than several of my older laptops.  Keys are solid, not spongy.<br />The dual video is nice on the battery also.  I went with the bigger battery<br />& charger.  The bigger battery has the advantage of tilting the entire laptop<br />up.  The sound on this thing is something to make you wonder how they get that<br />sort of sound out of a laptop.  The JBL logo on the bottom, I guess the entire<br />cavity of the laptop is a tuned port.  When it is sitting on a table, you can<br />really hear the bass pumping through.  The case speakers on the top side are<br />clear & pretty loud.  3 USB ports. One on the left, one in back, and a combo<br />e-sata/usb on the right.  USB 3 is plenty fast for my needs.  I use a  BT<br />mouse, and it works without any issue.<br />Battery life for my use is excellent.  I can have it charged, unplug it after<br />work at 5pm, put it in sleep mode, and leave it that way til the next day, and<br />it might use 1-3% of the battery, making startup faster.<br />Wireless works perfectly, no issues."

Escalated and found out the errors were because the seller installed unsupported third-party components and components that were beyond the motherboard's ability to support.<br /><br />The seller used third-party parts for the memory cards (16G each) and replaced the 128G SSD with a 512G SSD.  Dell Technologies's motherboard for this laptop only supports 8G memory cards and 128G SSD.  In addition, the board does not support third-party components and will generate error codes.<br /><br />Dell Technologies explained these issues void the warranty.  Contacted the seller and sent me a legal quote from Mag-Moss Warranty Act stating why Dell Technologies can't refuse my warranty.  The issue is the seller modified the laptop beyond its supportability.  Dell Technologies offers a laptop with this config that is supported but the seller opted to modify a lower-end laptop and sell it as a higher-end laptop.<br /><br />The point is the seller is deceptive in the product presentation and the issues can cause malfunctions with the laptop that Dell Technologies will not cover or fix.  I wouldn't have found this out if I had not happened to run a health diagnostic from Dell Technologies on the laptop."

5	"Toyota Corolla of Laptops, nice on the outside, and awesome on the inside"	"I actually purchased one of these from Dell Technologies (for $1050) while they where still offering them. I was shopping for a computer for our business and for gaming on the side. I was looking at some Advance computers when I went back to Dell Technologies home page and for kicks punched in 17 inch laptop w/ Nvidia video card and this computer popped up. At the time you couldn't get an alien ware computer that had these same specs (or close to) for less than $1800, but I was a little skeptical but bought it anyway and I've got to say I was not disappointed with it. I've had it about 6 months now and have not had one problem with it. Its an awesome computer. I play Rift with my children and can play it with the settings turned all the way up and it plays great. Gets kinds warm where the vent comes out on the left side, but like I said, I haven't had any real problems with it. I don't know if what these people are asking is a real good price now but I assume their trying to get their interest back, but I can't say I blame them for trying, but I will say this, I just bought my oldest boy an Advance 17in for around $1600. So if you got a little more to spend... well that's up to you.<br />Hope this helped :-)"	B00F28K0X2	AEEJOBAE7WYS24HX6JUOCE5MAR7Q	1.39E+12	3	Computers	"Dell Technologies Worktop 17R 7720 3D Special Edition Laptop i17Rse-2436ALU Aluminum - 17.3"" 3D Full HD 1080p LED Display with Truelife/i7-3630QM/8.0GB DDR3/2TB HDD+32GB SSD/Nvidia GeForce GT 650M 2GB/Blu-ray Disc (BD) Combo/HD WebCam/Backlid keyboard/Windows 8 Home Premium 64-bit"	4	2	"[17.3"" 3D Full High Definition (1080p) LED Display with Truelife, 3rd Generation Intel Core i7-3630QM (6MB cache, up to 3.4Ghz), 8GB Dual Channel DDR3 SDRAM at 1600MHz, 2TB 5400RPM SATA HDD + 32GB mSATA SSD w/ Intel Smart Response, Blu-ray Disc (BD) Combo (Reads BD and Writes to DVD/CD), NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M GDDR5 2GB, 6 cell battery, 1MP HD Webcam]"	None	Dell Technologies	"[Electronics, Computers & Accessories, Computers & Tablets, Laptops, Traditional Laptops]"				2	1.5	29347	Windows 8		Dell Technologies

5	Great speed with 32GB and 1TB SSD hard disk	"I really like the G5 and actually bought one and later another one. The second one arrived with the headset plugin not working. I tested a couple of headset and see them not working on the laptop and working in another laptops. In addition, stayed with Microsoft tech for hours and reinstall headset drives and demonstrate the software was all good and therefore the issue was the headset connector from the laptop that may be was having a bad contact. To solve it quickly I bought a new head set with USB entry and that allowed me to use the headset from other entry to the laptop.  Although took me time to address and resolve the issue, I still think this is a great laptop and recommend it with the best wishes your headset works and if not, hope you can use one of the usb port. Best speed ever and we have about 5 laptops in the house so we can compare and confirm it is good."

5	Don't know why there are bad reviews	"There is nothing wrong with this laptop. I purchased it for at home use and to use at school. Works perfectly, almost. The audio was awful with headphones sometimes, but it was a easy fix with Google. Just Google the laptop name and like bad audio or static. Fixed easy and hasnt been an issue since.<br />Update over 6 months later:<br />Has a little scraping under keyboard from me using it as a standing tablet too harshly. I've only had 1 issues with the pen, where it didn't work, but I was easily fixed by restarting the laptop. Has worked great with no issues. I use it for school, great for note taking either typing or writing, and great for at home, playing games (like minecraft) and watching videos. Still love this laptop."

No need for me to have 4k LCD, more battery etc.<br />Cons: screen brightness could be better.<br />On newest laptops even not Dell Technologies (Lenovo) I cannot use a USB mouse as left-handed, and the touchpad as right-handed.

1	Worst Dell Technologies product ever	"I've had many Dell Technologies products over the past 20 years and they have all been great. That's why I was so surprised that the Mercury is such a bad product. When running any graphical software like SketchUp, the unit heats up and the fan emits a high pitch scream that's unbearable. To remain in the same room with the unit, it's necessary to reduce the performance settings so it doesn't heat up. So, I paid for an I7 with 16MB of RAM and an Nvidea board, but it runs like a Kindle. And then there's the monitor. It had such poor color fidelity that it looks like a child's water color painting.

2	"Nice Laptop, but missing key features"	"Bought this laptop directly from Dell Technologies. It has great specs for the price. However, after setting up the laptop, I ran into a couple key features that make this a deal-breaker and I plan to return the box. First the camera on this laptop is not compatible with the Windows 10 Hello facial recognition feature, so make sure you get the finger print reader, if you want to do use bio-metrics login features. Second, and most important, this box does not support ""Wake Timers"". This is an important feature if you want to be able to run scheduled tasks during the off hours while the PC is in ""sleep"" mode. For example, if you want to run backup jobs during the night while you are not using the PC. Any schedule task will not be able to ""wake"" the PC, so all of these tasks must be performed while the PC is awake. This is unbelievable for a 'business class' machine. Also, the BIOS does not support ""Wake on LAN"" function either, which means you can not use remote desktop to access a sleeping PC. I tested these features extensively and was not able to get them to work. I also contacted Dell Technologies Support and worked with their 2nd level support team to find a solution. But none was found.<br /><br />I wanted to really like this machine, but these missing features have spoiled the fun."

4	Slim but heavy.	"Screen is bright enough to where it's comfortable to your eyes but I feel like not bright enough to do any work outside.  I have it set at the brightest setting to work comfortably at home.  It's fast but make sure you get the PCIe NVMe version not SSD, it makes a huge difference. Keyboard is off to the side in order to fit in a key pad but that makes for awkward typing, takes getting used to.  Definitely not a gaming machine, graphics are too weak but for work it's nice to have the extra screen real estate.  It's a 15"" laptop in a 14"" body due to slim bezel. Decent camera although I wish there was a privacy slider like many other manufacturers are starting to include in their products.  Nice selection of ports but missing Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.1 gen2.  I feel like Dell Technologies skipped out on some components to keep the price lower but I still think that USB 3.1 gen2 should be the current standard.

4	"The laptop specs itself is quite amazing, one of the best win laptop out there"	"Ok I bought my xps 9560 from Dell Technologies.ca but thought I'd leave a review here for others that are looking to buying. The laptop specs itself is quite amazing, one of the best win laptop out there. The 4k screen is awesome too. Only thing I didn't like about it is my specific one had the wobbly chassis, I guess it was slightly bent so it doesn't sit perfectly flat on the table. Had to physically bend the keyword area in the opposite direction to get it perfectly flat. This is fine but for a $2k+ laptop you'd expect better. Mine also had a massive fingerprint on the bottom right corner of the screen fresh out of the box, which I hope is from a technician while boxing and not signs of Dell Technologies selling returned laptops. Again not a big deal but still not the best experience. As for cool whine, it's present but not very noticeable unless I stick my ear against the keyboard. Wifi seems to be ok but haven't had it long enough to see if problems occur. Speakers are decent, not the best but not as bad as some others are saying. All in all a great machine, but not a 5 star for me."

5	This laptop is incredible.	"Got my machine refurbished from Price Watchers. I couldn’t be happier. Price Watchers was phenomenal, machine is phenomenal. I will say this though, the 9560’s have a known issue with their Killer WiFi cards. This card is Dell Technologies’s fault alone and not the seller’s or Amazon’s fault. They are unstable and can cause a lot of issues with your router. I’m a console gamer, YouTuber and streamer. I have fios with an 8ms ping. This WiFi card will cause me to have a 75ms ping and will screw up matchmaking as well. The machine does not have an Ethernet port. Did some research and you can get an Intel 8265 card right here on amazon for $18 which is the best card you can replace it with. I ordered and swapped out with no issues. Took five mins. Note, if you do this make sure your black and white antenna wires are lined up to the + & - leads correctly. The Intel was reversed from the Killer card. And download the Intel drivers from the Intel site BEFORE you swap the cards.<br />If you need any help just hit me off with a question on here.<br />The laptop is gorgeous and absolutely flies. Display is amazing.<br />PRICE WATCHERS WAS INCREDIBLE AS A FULFILLER TO WORK WITH. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM."

1	The camera is at the bottom of the screen!!!!	"I just this computer today so my feedback is purely on usability and not on its computing power.<br /><br />I cannot believe someone would design a laptop with the camera located at the bottom of the screen near the keyboard.  I do a lot of video calls, and typically like to type to take some notes, but when I do that on this computer, my fingers get in the way of my photo since the camera is right in front of the keyboard.  Did they really do usability test on this computer and have people use the camera?  Besides, the camera takes about 3 seconds to snap s picture - my iPhone is immediate. I cannot understand why that is with such a powerful computer.<br /><br />Another silly design issue.  When you close the screen, the top piece tightly snaps to the bottom part and there is no place/groove to put your fingers in to open it back. You almost have to use your nails to get the lid up to open it.<br /><br />Very poorly designed computer."

3	"No stylus, no windows Pro."	"Originally, I gave this review:<br /><br />Gave three stars for inaccurate description on the website. The laptop does not come with either a stylus or Windows Pro. (Windows Home). Merchant should update  the catalog.The merchant, however, I learned is a  hostage to what Dell Technologies decides to ship.<br /><br />My updated review is all about the PC itself. Frankly, this will be the last Dell Technologies I ever buy--and this from a longtime follower.<br /><br />I feel that the Dell Technologies ABC is behind the curve technologically. Their sleep mode is so slow. Despite the fact that my Dell Technologies has 32 G ram, when it goes to sleep it's seems almost as slow as a hard reboot. I also have a Macbook Pro 2016 and it wakes from sleep almost instantaneously. Also, compared to the Mac, Dell Technologies's finger print recognition is laughable. It is so inconsistent that I finally disabled it. Lastly, I hate the over-sized track pad on the Dell Technologies because my palms hit it and cause me to retype.<br /><br />So I hope some other PC manufacturer will step up and provide the quality that the Dell Technologies name USED to provide."

4	"Great laptop with a few annoyances. If you need desktop workstation power in a portable package, this is it."	"Not sure why this unit is getting so many negative reviews. The system isn't perfect, but there are compromises that have to be made when you have a bezel this small on a laptop display (odd webcam placement, ease of opening/one handed operation, etc). Out of the box, the first thing should be updating the BIOS to the most recent version, then downloading all of the current drivers from the Dell Technologies support site.<br /><br />The ABC15 is plenty powerful, and doesn't throttle the CPU under moderate to heavy workloads. Yes, the fan is audible during compute intensive periods, but I'd rather have a few dB of extra fan noise than a machine that throttles performance almost to a crawl. Equipped with the 45W i7-7700HQ, 32Gbs and the 1Tb NVme disk, it handles everything I've thrown at it quickly, and effortlessly.  Full disclosure, I'm not a gamer, so cannot comment on gaming performance.<br /><br />It's not perfect, however.  The 4K/UHD display is very glossy and reflective. While it's stunning to look at in ideal conditions, the glare from any light source makes it almost unusable in bright environments. In the dark, it acts like a mirror, so you spend most of your working time looking at yourself. The 4K resolution is, IMO, overkill for a screen this size also. While it's great for image editing to evaluate critical sharpness, many apps don't scale properly yet, and are almost unusable at 100% scaling. Colour accuracy once calibrated is quite good.  The ideal display for me would be something in between the FHD matte display, and this 4K glossy touch unit. I'd love a 2560x1600 matte, non-touch panel.  It would increase usability substantially, and add an extra couple of hours to the battery life. (which is just OK with the 4K screen, at about 3.5-4.5 hours, depending on usage).<br /><br />I have ordered a matte/anti-glare film to apply to the display, and will update once installed and in use.<br /><br />The SD card sticks out a few mm more than it needs to, and can get caught up when placing into, or removing from a laptop bag. Plenty of expansion slots though- USB-C, 2x USB3, audio out, and the SD card. The keyboard is decent, though doesn't have as much travel as the ThinkPad or HP units.<br /><br />The keyboard deck/wrist rest is a fingerprint and oil magnet. The fingerprint scanner is very fast, and very accurate. A quick swipe and you're set within a couple of seconds.<br /><br />All of the units reviewed by major tech publications had the Samsung NVme disks. The bulk of the units however, are shipping with slower NVme drives from Hynix and Toshiba. While it's not likely to impact the majority of users, publishing disk read rates of up to 3,200Mbps then shipping the units with read rates of approx 1,700Mbps is a bit disappointing.<br /><br />Overall a very powerful unit, relatively light and compact, and with a few minor issues.<br /><br />Edited to include update:  I picked up an anti-glare filter to reduce the reflections on the screen, and following all the instructions,  taking my time (even did it with the shower running, to reduce floating dust particles in the air), I couldn't get it applied evenly, without trapping air bubbles or dust underneath. Gave up and threw it out.<br /><br />Ultimately ended up selling the ABC15, and getting the Sharp 5520 (same chassis) with the FHD matte panel, and am much, much happier with it. Opted for the larger battery, and am getting significantly better battery life too."

4	"SSD 512 GB discription is not correct, OS on 2 TB slow drive, performance is not good."	"In product description, key features for this laptop, it is mentioned that High quality Intel PCIe Nvme 512GB SSD + 2000 GB Hard drive. But when I received this laptop, the 512GB was SATAIII SSD not PCIe Nvme SSD. So, description was not correct. Although, after I checked the BIOS Settings at boot time, it is mentioned that THERE IS a slot for PCIe MVME M.2 but it's empty meaning it's not populated with any drive. Also, for some unknown reason, Windows 10 OS was installed by Dell Technologies on the 2 TB very slow drive and the whole performance is really bad. I also noticed that 512 GB has an OS on it but Dell Technologies made 2 TB drive the primary one to boot from. Really bad choice. I would accept immediately if it had 1 TB PCIe MVME M.2 drive with more $150 instead of those both 2 poor drives since in my experience, if you want a blazing speed laptop, just order it with the fastest hard drive you can get, it doesn't matter other specs as much as drive. I would pay the difference between both, and I calculated it, it's about $100 to $150 diff. Both those poor hard drives can cost about $150, and 1TB MVME cost about $200 to $250, but the difference in performance is unmatchable. MVME Read speed can range between 1500MBytes/s to 3000 MBytes/s, while fastest SATA3 speed can get up to 540 MBytes/s and mechanical drives even much worse with up to 150 MBytes/s max, which makes the diff 6x - 9x, that's huge comparing to only $150 max diff.<br />Finally, the Turn On switch is at the bottom/right corner of the laptop and it's barely noticeable so it's not easy to turn it on, but I guess it'll become okay when you can adjust yourself to it.<br />Weight is okay regarding its screen 17.3 inches I guess. CPU fan noise is almost not noticeable and quite. No overheating issues at all. I never felt any heat at all. I tested battery for the first 30 minutes, battery lost 7% which makes it last for up to 6 hour with normal use, meaning no Youtub or videos or heavy graphics or v. games.<br />About 6 hours of battery for this huge laptop, that's very good job Dell Technologies.<br />======<br />Edit on 1/30/2019<br />So, after I wrote my previous review with 2 stars, I sent the seller HotDeal Express and he was amazingly responsive and positive. He immediately apologized because he was not aware with this issue and offered a free return label and replace SATA3 SSD drive with PCIe Nvme SSD and install Win 10 home x64 on the fast one with no extra charge. I would definitely buy from him again if I needed any product that he is selling. Also, now I see they changed the description to match the real drives and I think they sell it now with PCIe Nvme 512GB SSD + 2000 GB Hard drive.<br />Also they raised the price a little bit about $50, which I think they should do.<br />I'm changing my stars to 4 instead of 2 because of that."

5	Reliable laptop does everything	I bought this laptop for about $950 in November 2018 and I'm still using it everyday to this day. I've had no significant problems with it and it plays games well. The battery life is not bad either as long you put the laptop in power saver mode when it's not plugged in. If you are using high performance mode just to browse the web or watch videos it will needlessly eat through your battery in a matter of about 2 hours.<br /><br />I love the backlit keyboard. I tend to use it in the dark and it works great. I would prefer it if it were in all colors but of course I knew what I was paying for. The screen is anti-glare so I can use it without seeing any annoying glares at any angle -  a huge upgrade from my previous laptop.<br /><br />Completely satisfied with this purchase and if I went back in time I would make it again.

2	ABC PieceOfSh**	"I bought this unit directly from Dell Technologies.  From day 1 it blue screened at least 4-5 times each week.  The technicians worked on it every weekend and finally after 4-5 months the unit sent them an emai that the SSD was about to fail and needed to be replaced.  Sent it in, got it back, still blue screened me 1-2 times each week.  Then within a month or so of getting it back the mouse/touch pad began to raise up.  Now its been 2-3 months and you can stick a quarter under the pad.  Wrote them, they said send it back.

If your hard drive crashes even with the factory software re install disk your Windows 8 will never activate again so you might as well add another 129.99 for a new operating system.Dell Technologies will not provide support or keys.

4	Update windows ASAP	Okay so first off I would like to say is I saw tons of negative reviews after placing the order from the shipping company to the point where I was terrified. With that said the laptop shipped same day and had it a day early well now time for the moment of truth. Is this thing busted and broken like most reviews or did I get a good one?! I got a solid gaming laptop enough to handle the games I wanna play that are yeah years old by now but is running everything on high or ultra.<br /><br />The only issue I had was the Dell Technologies audio and Gforce audio drivers collided and force a black screen after having the pc for less then 24 hours. I shut down pc booted it hours later. Went in drives need updating I did that. I had to go to gforces website and manually uninstall then reinstall drivers to fix the problem. I have had zero problems since and the pc is running like a beast. I love it solid gaming laptop for the price can’t beat it.

5	Amazing for quality and price!	"This is not your top of the line gamer system, but after researching every single one out there that is a laptop, without spending thousands on them and finding out later that they have a limited hard drive and then have to addition SSD added, this is really not bad for the price.  For a gaming laptop, compared to one that is high quality that my daughters friend brought to the house and my daughters (this one) she keeps up well with the higher grade.  Little lagging, I got her an additional laptop fan), which seems to help tremendously as well.  Graphics are actually pretty good.  Since she is just using it for gaming and gaming only, I excluded Microsoft programs from it, and that made a world of difference too.<br /><br />I'd have to say for the price, I got a really good deal."

4	i love this little machine but problems exist	"I bought this for 678.95 in 2019 and bruh i see the price now and im like daaaaaaamn let me write a review.<br /><br />The good. This plays most games I've wanted to play beautifully. a major upgrade from standard integrated graphics cards on most pcs<br />The bad. kinda not so good for video editing or more intense games. works well for most games all things considered and handles small shot cut projects well. one issue is that by default it somehow defaulted to the integrated graphics card instead of the Nvidia one but a youtube video helped me fix that, still would rather that not had happened.<br /> The ugly. I bought this laptop in 2019, worked perfectly for like a year then the battery wouldn't charge. found a cheap replacement on Amazon and it worked. then it just didn't and always gave me an error message that battery wouldnt charge. I've replaced the battery and charger snd still no luck. learned that it could be fixed possibly by updating bios but uhh apparently it needs to be over a certain percentage to do that and it won't charge so......... yeah.....it only works off a power cable so essentially a desktop( for the same money you can get a waay better pre-built desktop). it looks cool but the bottom panel is cheap plastic and only is held on by tape. I'm not even really rough just removed it a few times to install more ram and replace the battery. just bruh.<br /><br />tips// upgrade the ram and if you do run into battery problems just buy the official del brand stuff because the OEM only works for a time and waste of money)<br /><br />I like it enough to give it 4 stars as you may not run into the same problems as me and I was pleased with this for a long time would've been 5 stars had problems not arisen (also I'd probably be pissed if I had spent 1k+ for it and had issues tho). Just a bummer the problems started just after the warranty ended. all things considered it'll take maybe 300$ and some time and effort to get this working right again( fixing the screen and battery and charger)."

5	Superior bang for the buck	"After reading and watching many reviews, chose the Dell Technologies G5 in this configuration as the best choice for me to do video editing on.  I bought it used-like new and it came as described, like new, but not in its original packaging.  It even had a few extra features.  First, the description said NONE for operating system, which I missed before buying, but it came with windows 10.  next, It has a backlit keyboard, which is an option on this computer, but it was not listed in the description.  BIG BONUS.<br /><br />Things i discovered while researching: 1.  you can not replace or upgrade the video card to a better one at a later date.  this is true for about 99% of all laptops produced.  so buy what you want now... 2.  The 8gb memory comes in one 8gb stick and, obviously, fills only one of the two memory slots.  i found a matching memory stick on Ebay for $40 and now have a 16gb machine.<br /><br />This is a fairly heavy, sturdy machine that i think looks great, although I am a bit older."

Honestly, really good looking laptop - I have it connected to Samsung 24"" LED - The only con is it has just 3 USB ports - but HDMI is very cool - along with the ESATA Port - Really love it and it' great looking!<br />I game on WIFI - and it is very capable on COD MW3- go get one!<br /><br />Updated*** Well, about 2 weeks ago - I just upgraded the memory to 16GB on this thing - I am wondering if down the road, whether or not the system can do 32GB - anyway, just a great laptop - someone did ask me regarding the blu ray upgrade - I did my homework and found a samsung blu ray drive on ebayy, but I did tell them that you need blu ray software - like power DVD 12 or something like that - Power DVD is what I use - it's worth $20 or $30 bucks I spent on it - This laptop is pretty much like a little beastie now! 16GB Ram ($65), 500GB Seagate Momentus XT Drive with 4 gig Nand SSD and 7200rpm (I had this HD drive for about 2 years lying around cost about $70 - my Dell Technologies now boots up in under 22 secs) + Samsung BluRay ($32) wow - and installed win 7 pro 64bit (no cost my version) - it's like a $1700 laptop - The Used Mac equivlant is about $1700 except no blu-ray... and of course Paid $389 off of ebayy - that includes shipping!!! tada....... by the way the NVidia Card is very close to a AMD/ATI HD67xx series cards - a while back ago I had an HP with a HD6750 great card - The GT525M just as good if not better - Handles all my games and the supports 1080p out through HDMI - Love it!!!"

Fixed that with JB Weld (found a YouTube video) and that worked.  But the other common problem (I later discovered) is the heat retention due to the lid covering the vents when lid is up.  I am guessing that heat might have later contributed to the motherboard finally going bad after about 3 years; was not worth the cost to fix and decided to replace the entire machine.<br /><br />The GTX 1661 Ti GPU is great for the money paid, and the 512 gb SSD is also nice.  But, the longevity of these G3s is questionable."

2	It overheats	"I cannot recommend this product, or Dell Technologies products in general.<br />The G7 7790 overheats terrible out of the box. updates do not fix it.<br />Dell Technologies has the CPU set to overclock by default which just causes it to shut itself off under load.<br />I was able to make the device usable, so if people purchased it already and need some help, here are some things you can do if you are reasonably savvy.<br />First, lower the voltage going to the CPU a bit. Undervolting and underclocking helped the heat issue.<br />Second, reapply the thermal paste for the CPU and GPU. I disassembled it and found that they used really bad thermal paste and it wasn't applied very well. So take it apart, clean it off with some alcohol wipes, and use Arctic or Cooler Master or something better.<br />After adjusting clocks and redoing the thermal compound, my GPU and CPU run about 70ish degrees under load. I've noticed the fans are a lot quieter and it cools down way faster after gaming.<br /><br />One thing I did like about mine, is they included the ribbon cable to connect an SSD.<br />I purchased mine with the smaller 512gb m.2, and took it apart to upgrade it, and saw that the ribbon cable was included for a second storage device which was a nice surprise."

Add another 2 or 3 min to be able to open any applications like games or even the internet. And several minutes for my internet browser to run properly and not slow as hell. Sometimes it takes me about 15min or so for it to run as it should al the while its hot as hell and the fans are running faster than light. I tried everything Dell Technologies says to do to make it work and nothing has changed plus every update makes it worst. Please, dont get Dell Technologies computers."

4	A Good and Fast Machine	"I have now had this laptop about 2 weeks. Since I use it mostly for work, I have been on it 8-10 hours a day since I received it.<br /><br />These are my impressions so far:<br /><br />  1) Overall, it's an excellent laptop. I bought a machine with SSD, quad core, NVIDIA and 16GB of RAM because I need a fast machine for work (it's advertised for gaming but I do no gaming at all). It's speed has not disappointed me. Slow hard disks are the pits, but this machine gets up and running within 10 seconds (with most of that time taken up with my typing credentials, etc.). Everything being on SSD is very nice and since I save all my files to the cloud, I don't need a hard disk beyond Windows, Office and a few other things.<br />  2) I've always liked the Dell Technologies keyboard, and after being on a terrible ASUS keyboard for 5 years, I'm very glad to be back on a Dell Technologies.<br />  3) Screen is plenty sharp and have no problems with that. I hook up the laptop to a large monitor via HDMI and have no issues.<br />  4) General navigation is fast and, again, no issues. The only slowness comes sometimes from Office and/or Windows, but that's not an issue with the laptop per se.<br />  5) I've used Dell Technologies SupportAssist a few times and found it helpful.<br /><br />So far, I've only had two issues to deal with:<br />  1) Sound quality is inconsistent. I don't need the sound system all that much in my work, so it's a minor inconvenience for me, but if you're into gaming and depend on it more, it could become a major inconvenience.<br />  2) The mousepad (or something else) has completely frozen the machine 2-3 times so far. I'm still in the process of looking up this issue, and don't know if it's due to Windows or Dell Technologies. I've powered down the system and powered back up and have no problems afterward, but I'd like to try to resolve it. One recommendation from another source was to get a USB mouse, though I don't know if that will resolve it or not.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good system, and if you have a heavy workload and need to be on your system hours at a time, then I would recommend it."

5	Best Laptop I Have Ever Used	"Previously i had owned an HP dv4 laptop with mid range specs and when that one craped out on me i went searching for a really nice laptop to replace it.  I decided on the ABC 15 because it is in all aspects an incredible machine.  For starters, this thing has a really powerful processor and a great dedicated GeForce graphics card that has thrown through every game I've thrown at it.  The hard drive is also pretty fast and offers a good amount of storage space and 4gb of ram is pretty sweet.  Basically the internal specs on this thing are really good and will defiantly meet the needs of practically anyone; gamers, digital designers, students, anybody.  This laptop is also really nice in its design and does some very smart things that a lot of other laptops don't seem to offer.  The chaise is almost entirely made out of aluminum and it feels pretty think; so far i haven't encountered any areas where the metal flexes or makes creaking noises.  One of the biggest problems facing the functionality of laptops is the cooling system.  On laptops that are not properly ventilated the processor will over heat under enough stress and the laptop will crash (this was the main problem with the dv4).  I think the best example of proper laptop cooling can be found in the Asus G73 but the ABC 15 comes in pretty close.  On the left hand side of the laptop there is a large heat sink and vent that does a very good job at regulating the temp.  To speak to this, while playing Fallout 3 on ultra setting the air coming out of the vent is pretty warm and would feel uncomfortable keeping your hand in front of it but the palm rests and keyboard remain cool to the touch.  This thing is built like a tank (personally i hate throwing down a bunch of cash for a laptop only to find its construction feels cheap, this however feels very nicely put together).  The track pad is also nice and large and has a slight matte finish that helps your fingers glide across it a bit better.  The other two things that really surprised me about this machine were one, the webcam which at 2.0 MP doesn't seem like a lot but actually provides a very nice image, and the speakers.  Since getting this laptop i have done away with my desktop speakers because the JBL speakers and subwoffer (yeah its got a subwoffer) sound amazing.  This laptop really is amazing and i think it should defiantly be considered by anyone looking to get a new computer.<br /><br />p.s.  I custom built mine on Dell Technologies's website only because i wanted to add a backlit keyboard (only $20 extra) but the rest of my components were the standard ones you get when you buy it out right."

4	Great Quality	"This is an excellent laptop made of high quality materials. I will give some of the pros and cons. I owned the previous Dell Technologies ABC 15 with the RGBLED display and sandy bridge processor.<br /><br />Pros<br />1.Excellent Audio Quality. (This laptop is louder than the previous Dell Technologies ABC 15 with JBL speakers and subwoofer) this was a positive surprise.<br />2.Display is definitely high quality. Colors really look good and edge to edge gorilla glass makes display look even better<br />3.Case Quality/Design  Brushed aluminum is very high quality and rubberized material on top and bottom feels good<br />4.Excellent Keyboard. No Flex. Very easy to type on.<br />5.Quieter than other Dell Technologies ABC 15<br />6.32 GB SSD helps with a very fast boot time<br />7.Very good Battery Life<br /><br />Cons<br />1. Not an IPS display. (Vertical viewing angles could be better)<br />2. No subwoofer<br />3. Overpriced! This is my opinion. I think the price will come down a bit, maybe to 1199. It does not include 3610 processor and GT 640/650 graphics card.<br />4. Weak Wifi (Needs an update badly, I really hope it happens soon. It is pretty bad)<br /><br />This is an excellent laptop but should probably be priced $100 less. I would recommend this laptop to anyone. It just feels really good and it is relatively lightweight. If offers many features and still remains much cheaper than an equivalent Macbook Pro laptop. I still think this laptop is a good buy and would give it a 90/100. It is a bit better than 4/5 but not quite 5 stars. You immediately notice the design and quality of materials is top of the line. As I stated earlier, this laptop does not have RGBLED display, nor does it have the JBL sound system. However, it is very interesting because the image quality is simply incredible when looking at photos and watching videos. Sound quality is also very very good and it is much louder than the previous Dell Technologies ABC 15.<br /><br />For the price, they should have put a better graphics card and larger power brick to have better gaming performance. Dell Technologies offers better but heavier gaming laptops with their Advance laptops. This laptop is very portable and most people will not do heavy gaming. The computer should be able to handle most of the games on medium and a number of them on high settings."

I called tech support and a gentleman I could barely understand told me the only option I have its to mail it to them it will be $100 to look at it and repairs will be extra and they will have the laptop for over a month.  How could Dell Technologies describe their warranty program as &#34; an outstanding limited warranty&#34;.  That is a below standard warranty.  Don't purchase this laptop.  Buy a Mac.

2	A lot of problems with Wireless card and graphics	"I am not satisfied with this product, since I have had a lot of issues related with the Killer Wireless adapter and the graphics management.<br />First, the pc freezes randomly, and it is not possible to move among windows only until I close an open again the laptop. Investigating about it on internet, it is a known problem with the Dell Technologies ABC 15 and  as a workaround for this, you need to disable some options from the Intel Graphics Command Center.<br />Second, every time I put the laptop to sleep, or even when it locks the session after some time of inactivity, the pc looses the connectivity to internet for a while, and it recovery itself some minutes after this happens.<br />Both of these issues are annoying and unjustifiable for a laptop which costs about $2000. It feels like a scam for this price. Please, help yourself and avoid to buy a Dell Technologies (and windows) laptop for this costs."

5	High-End Goodness	"First, please be aware that Amazon often mixes reviews for various optional models on a single item’s page. That is the case with the reviews here.<br /><br />THIS review is specifically for the Dell Technologies ABC 9700 17-inch Ultra High-Definition+ Touch Screen laptop with the 1Tb NVMe hard drive, the 6-cell (97 Watt-Hour) battery, the 130-Watt rapid charger, 10th Generation Intel Core i9-10885H processor, 32 Gb RAM, Qualcomm Killer AX500s DBS Wi-Fi module, Bluetooth 5.2, and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 video graphics processor with 6Gb dedicated memory to supplement the built-in Intel UHD Graphics 630 CPU based graphics.<br /><br />This is, by all measures, a top-of-the-line powerful, capable, and stylish laptop with excellent battery life, fast charging, and an amazingly sharp and bright display. Despite its slim and sleek profile, it is a workhorse with an amazingly large 17” screen in a package just a half inch deeper than my old HP 15.4-inch laptop and much thinner and lighter. Open, it has a handsome “carbon fiber” look keyboard platform, a huge touch-pad, and that stunning wide-viewing-angle 3840 X 2400 9.2 Megapixel screen with a minuscule .0954mm pixel pitch. Closed, it is all metal on the outside.<br /><br />As I began to put it through its various usability tests, I found that the laptop was, as expected, amazingly fast and responsive. Cold boot times are on the order of 20-25 seconds from opening the lid (if using facial recognition sign on) and wake-up from sleep averages 7-9 seconds.<br /><br />I configure the laptop to use three different sign-on schemes, PIN, fingerprint reader, and facial recognition. As expected, PIN works flawlessly every time but if it is a number only PIN, the lack of a dedicated number pad on the keyboard slows entry somewhat. Dell Technologies could perhaps have chosen to narrow the keys and relocate the two stereo speakers that flank the keyboard thereby gaining enough space for a number pad, but it would have required that the keyboard be compact instead of the comfortably large standard-size keys that are a joy to type on.<br /><br />After configuring the fingerprint reader, it too flawlessly recognized my fingerprint quickly and reliably every time and rejected all other attempts at using the wrong fingerprint. It is, in this application a viable security method in my opinion. Lastly, I engaged the facial recognition feature of sign-in. This means that you will need to allow camera operation, so the typical piece of tape over the camera practiced by paranoid users will defeat this function. It is, by far, the fastest and easiest of the sign-in options and, like the fingerprint reader, accurate and reliable. I did a little testing whether it could be fooled by a good picture or a selfie on a large tablet, and it did not respond to those “hacks”, but like any security system, I’m sure it can be defeated with enough effort. Still, it worked perfectly for me scores of times using my actual face.<br /><br />Once all the Windows set-up questions were completed, I began installing various programs and applications for my use. Since, like most modern “slim” laptops, this computer lacks a CD / DVD drive, I had to employ an external one to load some of my older applications. The laptop comes with a pair of USB 3.2 Gen 2, DisplayPort 1.4 (supporting up to HBR2), Thunderbolt 3 ports on each side, and using a USB C to USB A adapter, my old external drive was immediately recognized.<br /><br />The ABC 17 came with some Dell Technologies applications pre-installed. Some may consider them as “bloat-ware,” although I found many of them useful. Dell Technologies’s Support Assistant, for instance, keeps drivers up to date and performs a “tune-up” on demand. Similarly, Dell Technologies Power Manager is very useful for customizing battery life. I recommend giving them a chance and deciding which ones are useful for you and removing the rest later.<br /><br />During extensive use testing, I ran up against some limitations of the included Windows 10 Home operating system. Therefore, after a few weeks, I upgraded the OS to Windows 10 Pro using a complete reformat and clean install. This required that I re-visit the Dell Technologies support site and re-install some of the more useful Dell Technologies utilities and features, but I found the process to be smooth and trouble free. Once win 10 Pro was installed, I began to work the computer in earnest.<br /><br />If you use very processor-intensive applications the two internal fans will spool up and can be somewhat noisy, but during typical use they rarely engage. During high resolution gaming, expect the fans to run continuously at varying speeds. Temperature control seems adequate to keep the outside of the laptop comfortably cool. For a slim laptop, the built-in speakers and two rear “subwoofer” ports provide remarkably good sound. The built-in sound card can drive a full multi-channel setup given the right external adapter and speakers.<br /><br />The lack of a LAN port (RJ-45) was almost always compensated by the very capable and strong Wi-Fi adapter that connected almost instantly to either of my two home wireless networks whenever the computer was awakened. But, in the interest of running some file transfer tests across my LAN, to and from my NAS servers, I acquired an Anker 11-in-1 USB 3 hub that allows for a wired Ethernet connection (among many other options).<br /><br />Using the Anker hub, and running many hours of tests, I discovered that the laptop’s built-in USB 3.2 ports can handle virtually any challenge at top speed. Not once did the laptop limit transfer speeds. Rather, the limits of the Gigabit LAN or the hardware of the various external drives I used determined maximum speeds. Additionally, the hub allowed me to use two external 1080p monitors, and although the ports are rated up to 4K, unfortunately I did not have any displays to test that with. The laptop easily supports external displays in “duplicate” or “extended desktop” modes.<br /><br />Next, I ran the laptop on battery power alone during a routine day of authoring and browsing and emailing via the Wi-Fi connection. Battery life was exceptional despite purposely running the display at higher than recommended brightness. After nearly 7 hours of work with few interruptions the battery meter still read around 18%. Using the supplied 130-Watt charger, it recovered the full charge in just under two hours, which makes this one of the most portable and usable field machines I have ever used. My vehicle, which has a 110V outlet in the console and a built-in Wi-Fi hotspot make for an exceptionally productive mobile office using this computer.<br /><br />When you first get started with this high-end laptop, you will undoubtedly find that some of the functions do not perform exactly the way you want them to. One of the most important is how the touch-pad responds to your touch. I need to say, unequivocally, that THIS laptop is NOT the one so many reviewers have panned for its touch-pad issues. First, there are many settings that can be applied to customize the touch-pad sensitivity, response, and functions. This touch-pad is glorious to use. It is big enough to allow for incredible pointing detail and can easily be set to move the cursor fully across the screen with a single swipe. It makes “Click and Drag” functions fast and simple. The touch-pad is rock solid, doesn’t move in its frame, is silent, and bulls-eye accurate. All the multiple finger gestures are supported and customizable. It works so well that I hardly, if ever, resort to the touch screen. There is, of course, an option to add an external mouse, and even a setting that allows you to have the built-in touch pad turn off when you connect the mouse so you can use the panel as a wrist rest without inadvertently moving the cursor.<br /><br />If, while you are using this laptop, you find one of its functions annoying or imperfect, it’s my belief that buried somewhere in Windows or a Dell Technologies app, there’s a setting for it that will allow you to fine tune it to your liking. You just may have to hunt for it.<br /><br />This is an ideal, fast, beautiful business / graphics laptop that will work at lightning speed to get your jobs done. It’s a high-rez, clear-screen gamer with a very fast and capable NVIDIA graphics adapter. It’s a looker, and easy to carry, charge, and use. Information storage and retrieval is virtually instant due to the fast i9 CPU and the extremely fast and huge NVMe drive. It is fast booting and runs most apps at blazing speeds.<br /><br />But, I do have a few quibbles to comment on perhaps to prove that nothing is perfect.<br /><br />First, for me, it’s a shame that such a powerful laptop comes with Win 10 Home, not Win 10 Pro. Since it is such a strong business machine, I would expect that it will be used in a domain environment. Win 10 Home does not support domains, nor do they allow remote access. You have to upgrade to Pro for $99 retail to fix that.<br /><br />Next, there is an included USB 3 adapter to hook an external display and any standard USB-A cabled accessory, but it does not have a LAN port. Again, in business , you may want to hook to a wired network for internal security, and that requires a third party adapter. Both adapters I did try to use for this worked flawlessly and at full LAN speeds though.<br /><br />The camera is weak. It only supports 1280 by 720 resolution, which given the exceptional graphics screen on this machine, is inadequate. It does work just fine for conferencing though.<br /><br />Ergonomically, three things strike me as negatives. One, the case is actually hard to open, as it has no real grip point on the front to swing open the screen and it is stiff to open. Maybe it will loosen with time. Second, you cannot fold this back to use it as a tablet, despite the touch screen. To me, that is truly minor, but others may feel it is more important. Third, the front edge of the body where one naturally rests one’s hand when using the touch-pad is not rounded in any way. It is a sharply defined edge that eventually irritates the heel of your hand after hours of use. I started using an external mouse when I intended to work long hours on it.<br /><br />Lastly, the computer comes with some “bloat-ware.” Some is from Microsoft, some is from Dell Technologies. Some of the included apps are actually useful, but I found some to be just a waste of storage space. Your needs may dictate that you will have to systematically remove some of these apps.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a fabulous high-end laptop. Comparing it to my brother’s premium Macbook Pro, it is very similar in performance and yet is considerably less expensive than the Mac. It is backed by what I consider to be an industry leader in support and service and backed by a very extensive support website. It never crashed, faltered, or failed to run anything I tasked it with.

5	The value of this laptop comes from detail	"This ABC 17 is a system for a well-informed professional without much budget constraints. Such a person would value presentation, portability and pixel count over raw performance, but they also have enough computing needs to refuse to compromise too much on performance.<br />Value: If you just want to game on a laptop, you can get basically the same GPU of RTX 2060 and a better AMD cpu of Ryzen 4900hs from the ASUS Zephyrus G14. At $1400 as of this review, the Zephryrus is a far more attractive option based on the numbers. However, there are many details Dell Technologies put onto this laptop that makes it possibly worth the +$1000 premium (As of this review, the current generation ABC 17 can be as low as $2400 depending on where you look)<br />Screen: If you have good eyes and a need for screen pixel estate, the glossy 4K+ screen is absolutely gorgeous and can fit a ton of windows and spreadsheets when scaled to 100%. The touchscreen adds a way to efficiently interact with it. This screen is basically bezel-less, you get 17” of screen in a laptop the size of a 15” laptop, indeed I was able to fit this laptop in a bag compartment for 15” laptops only where my old 17” gaming laptop would definitely not fit. The high resolution and normal (I assume 60hz) refresh rate makes it a productivity machine, as opposed to gaming machines with lower resolution and higher refresh rates.<br />GPU: You can game with modern titles, but games would not necessarily be able to run at 4K and still get a good framerate. Compared to my 4 year old gaming laptop with an nVidia GTX 980M, the RTX 2060 max-q in the ABC offers basically the same performance and some new features in a much smaller package. And I know my GTX 980M struggled with games a lot, even at 1080p. The 2060 Max Q is considered “VR-ready” and most games developed for VR should be playable, however normal games with VR mode are more demanding and could struggle to run.<br />CPU: The only reason to choose Intel for this generation is if there are some Intel-specific features you need for your work, or if the rest of the laptop happens to be quite good as is the case here and you’re willing to compromise on the CPU. While by no means a slouch, you are not getting the best laptop CPU in terms of performance and efficiency. The Intel I9-10885H is worse than the AMD R9 4900HS in every way with higher power consumption and lower processing speed, the only exception being slightly better single thread performance - a small consolation in a world where developers are used to optimizing apps for multiple threads. A workload I use a lot is x264 video encoding. Measuring the power draw and frames processed over 12 hours, the i9 has double the efficiency as my 5 year old i7, but 20% less efficiency than my desktop ryzen 3900x. Less efficiency also means more heat: with ideal cooling conditions (a 50W box fan blowing on the laptop), the CPU was able to draw about 90W more power than idle.<br />As a system, the CPU+GPU combination was able to playback youtube 8K60 content with no stuttering.<br />Ports: I like the ports on this laptop, there are 4 thunderbolt/type C ports which serve to both transmit data and charge the laptop. A 130W usb C charger is included, you can also charge using a USB PD (Power Delivery) charger. This is exciting as it opens up the possibility of charging a full size gaming laptop from a USB C power bank via the PD protocol: My current on-the-go tablet, a Surface 3, was purchased entirely on the basis that at the time, it was the fastest windows powered x86 machine I could get that could be charged from a power bank.<br />Battery: A fully charged battery can last more than 3 hours of casual use, or 90 minutes with the CPU at 100%. My attempts to charge the ABC 17 from various power banks 10W-60W and prolong its runtime when not connected to mains, were met with limited success: Starting with both batteries at 100% hoping that the power bank would slow down the discharge rate, older power banks simply would not charge. Newer power banks would connect, but because type c to type c is non directional, the laptop would attempt to charge the power bank instead of letting the power bank charge it (there doesn’t seem to be a software switch to toggle direction of power). Finally, the PD power banks appeared to start charging the laptop after the laptop’s battery dropped below 80%.<br />Dongle: The laptop has only type C ports so regular peripherals will need to be connected via dongles or hubs. A basic HDMI+USBA dongle is included in the package. There are many dongles but I recommend getting one with full 4K 60hz video output and 100W PD, which allows you to charge the laptop through the dongle while freeing up the other ports for more dongles! A well-made single dongle will simultaneously: transfer 4K60 video signal to an external screen, copy files from external usb A hard disks and internal sd card readers at combined 200 megabytes/s, pipe in 900 megabits/s of internet upload/download, and power the laptop from an external PD power source<br />Longevity: This laptop includes the “Dell Technologies Power Manager” utility that allows you to limit charge to a number less than 100% if you keep your laptop plugged in all the time. Keeping batteries topped off at 100% is bad for longevity – I’ve experienced multiple battery failures on devices I need to leave plugged in 24/7. Capping charge at 60% will maximize battery longevity while 80% will give you a bit more flexibility if there is a power outage or if you need your laptop for an unplanned excursion. If you don’t know what percentage to use, you can leave Power Manager on auto or set it to one of several presets. The technology to limit charging has been around for ages, disappointingly not all manufacturers include this function. The ABC is also a model where you don’t have to worry about availability and instructions for replacing the battery.<br />Software: Windows Hello, using infrared facial recognition to unlock the PC, is a very convenient alternative to passwords. 365 days of McAfee LiveSafe are included although I have not had good experiences with McAfee antivirus in the past.<br />Keyboard: In exchange for the lack of a numpad, you get normal sized backlit keys and nice speakers on the sides of the keyboard. The way the Fn key works is interesting as an inversion of how Fn usually works: the F1/ F2… keys activate the Fn functions by default, if you want to input F4 you have to press Fn+F4. Commands like Alt+F4 still work as usual.<br />Condition: The specs and condition of my unit appeared to be as described and there was no malfunction or inaccuracy in any way.<br />Summary: If you know what you’re getting into, the current generation Dell Technologies ABC 17 is a quality asset to your professional or personal needs, engineered for the long haul. A pricey machine that maximizes the utility of a portable small size, the ABC 17 is capable of gaming but best used for productivity or entertainment where fine detail makes a difference."

1	Very Poorly Designed Laptop	"I am very disappointed at this Dell Technologies ABC 17 laptop. It is supposed to be Dell Technologies's top-of-the-line laptop but is is not.<br />What I hated about this horrible laptop:<br />No numeric keypad.....this is unpardonable being a large 17 inch model.<br />It only comes with USB-C ports. There is absolutely no USB-A ports, so you cannot use any of your usb flash drives or your usb wireless mouse receiver. If I got the available from Amazon a USB-C to USB-A adapter it will stick out my Logitech Unifying receiver by an extra 2 inches that I will be forced to remove whenever I put it in a sleeve or a laptop case. Not a practical solution.<br />It does not come with a touch screen.<br />I had no adjustment for my screen brightness control, maybe I was unlucky to have this defect.<br />I returned this very poorly designed laptop and a big shame on Dell Technologies to release such a junk model and call it their best."

1	Track pad was wobbly. The whole tech support process has been a nightmare	Picked up the laptop and the trackpad was wobbly. Jumped through a ton of hoops to get a repair dude to show up. He delays and delays and finally comes out late. Then after he comes out he strips a screw. Forcefully takes apart the computer and then scratches and bends up the whole thing. Now I need to explain this whole occurrence back to Dell Technologies and I have been on hold for way to long. This whole journy has sucked.

4	Good but not great	"The Dell Technologies ABC 17 is probably one of the best, Windows based, personal laptop computers that you can buy, there are some many things that Dell Technologies did right with this generation of the ABC 17, and at the same time there are so many things that they missed and could have done much better.<br />Let me start by listing all the positives and the features I absolutely love about this model:<br /><br />- Excellent build quality, the chases, the screen, the keyboard, everything is on a apple level of quality, if not even better in some cases, for example the chases feels heavier and more solid.<br />- Screen size and quality - yes, being able to fit a 17 inch screen in a 15 inch frame, sort of speak, is quite incredible, the screen is plenty bright with 400 nits, the resolution at 4K is good, but only if you are a content creator, about that a little bit more later, and last there is touch for those that like that feature on a laptop, personally I am not a fan.<br />- Top level CPU combined with a great nVidia RTX2060 MaxQ - now here we have indeed a great CPU represented by the Intel Core I9 10885H with 8 cores and 16 threads, this CPU can deliver a great productivity and is a very capable gaming chip as well. The RTX2060 MaxQ is also still a very good mobile GPU and is great for video rendering and games as well, but about that a bit later.<br />- Keyboard and touchpad - To me this keyboard and touchpad are one of the best I have used in the last few years, despite the fact that the keyboard is not full size with the numeric pad on the side, it is still very responsive and comfortable to type on, and the touchpad, well is huge and that is convenient. Previous years and versions had an issue with the touchpad being wobbly, but this later version is perfect.<br />- Four Thunderbolt 3 ports, an SD card and 3.5mm headphone jack on board, TB3 to HDMI and USB-A adapter in the package as well, great port selection and all you need for your content creation.<br />- 32GB Ram and 1TB fast Nvme of internal storage - top level components that can get you started with your content creation, video editing and everything else.<br />- Included separate fingerprint sensor for easy access and Windows Hello.<br /><br /> Negatives:<br /><br />- The cooling system on board is not capable to effectively dissipate the temperatures produced by the CPU and the GPU - I was forced to disable the Turbo Boost in the bios in order to keep the temps in control, otherwise even the simple tasks were making the whole system heat up fast and the CPU temps were going over 100C almost all the time (and that is with 22-23C room temperature) causing the CPU to throttle. With the TB disabled, the temps were around 80C.<br />- 4K screen - While great for content creation and media consumption, pushing all those pixels can be challenging for the RTX2060 MaxQ, so gaming is almost impossible, unless you are willing to lower all game settings to the minimum possible. otherwise you are looking at 20-25 frames.<br />- Touch screen, maybe is just my personal preference, but not all laptops need to have touch, especially high-level production or gaming laptops.<br />- Battery life - obviously with such powerful components inside, the battery life is expected to be nothing amazing, but I was disappointed. Luckily most of the times I am not using the laptop plugged in as a desktop replacement work horse.<br />- Very expensive, and not only as a laptop, but computer in general. For the price of over $3K you can buy components to build an incredible desktop, even with the component crisis today, same goes for laptops, you can get a top level gaming laptop that can do everything you want.<br />- Having to use the included TB3 to HDMI adapter in order to output easily on a external screen.<br />- The included web camera on the screen doesn't match the price tag of the laptop, the quality is poor and for this price, it should have been at least a 2K camera with good quality.<br />- Because of the poor cooling solution, which btw even with repasting with good Thermal Grizzly past is not improving too much, you can really utilize the potential of all the top-level components.<br /><br />Overall, despite of the high-quality components and a build quality, it’s really hard to recommend this laptop, I think for the price, you would have a lot more and better choices."

1	Dell Technologies support is the absolute worst	"Purchased a top of the line version of this laptop (2TB SSD, 64 GB RAM, i9 processor) directly from Dell Technologies and straight from the factory it would do a hard shutdown every single time the battery reached 75%. After several sessions with them remoting into my computer and me installing dozens of firmware updates they had me ship it back to them. They replaced the battery and never checked out the actual problem because it still existed. Terrible, terrible, terrible customer support. They couldn't even be bothered to verify that the problem was corrected before they sent it back to me unfixed. Ultimately had to completely reinstall Windows to fix problem--after a month of them not fixing it."
